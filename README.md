Special thank to Fooocus for the amazing works.

## *Localization/Translation*

### We need your help! 
 
Please help translate Seduca into international languages.

You can put json files in the language folder to translate the user interface.

For example, below is the content of Seduca_Windows/language/example.json:

```
{
  "Generate": "generieren",
  "Text to Image": "Texte transform√© en image",
}
```
You can create a new branch and add the translation file.

If you add --language example arg, Seduca will read Seduca_Windows/language/your file.json to translate the UI.
